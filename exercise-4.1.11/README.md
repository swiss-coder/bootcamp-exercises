## Exercise 4.1.10 - Play with for loop

Construct for loops that accomplish the following tasks:

* Print the numbers 0 - 20, one number per line.
* Print only the ODD values from 3 - 29, one number per line.
* Print the EVEN numbers 12 down to -14 in descending order, one number per line.
* Print the numbers 50 down to 20 in descending order, but only if the numbers are multiples of 3.
