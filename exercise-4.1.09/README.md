## Exercise 4.1.9 - Make a key-less car

This car will only let you drive if you are over 18. Make it do the following:

* Use `prompt()` and `alert()`.
* Ask a user for their age.
* If they say they are below 18, respond with: "Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off" 
* If they say they are 18, respond with: "Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!"
*  If they say they are over 18, respond with: "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"
